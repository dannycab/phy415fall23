\section{Grading}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/0_syllabus:grading}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Details about \DUrole{xref,myst}{course activities are here} and \DUrole{xref,myst}{information regarding assessment is here}. Your grade will be comprised of completing weekly discussion questions, seven of eight worked problems, and three of four projects that you will complete in the form of a Jupyter notebook (a “computational essay”, which we will discuss later).

\sphinxAtStartPar
Your grade is comprised of the following:

Your grade on each project is split between completion (50\%) and quality (50\%). We will collectively define “quality” in class, but we have provided \DUrole{xref,myst}{a preliminary rubric} for us to work from for the first project. Your final grade will be scaled based on your best performances; there will be slightly more projects than what comprises your grade.  \sphinxstyleemphasis{The intent here is to to allow you space to explore a model or project that you really enjoy, and to reward you for doing that.} How your project grade is calculated appears below.

\section{“Extra” Credit}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/0_syllabus:extra-credit}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
We get that you might want to do more of the projects or maybe you fell a little behind during the semester. If you complete 8 of the 8 worked problems, you can earn up to another 5\%. If you complete four projects, then your lowest scoring project will be included up to an additional 10\%. These have to be completed within the usual due dates for the worked problems and projects; not at the end of the semester.

\sphinxstepscope


\section{Course Objectives}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/1_goals:course-objectives}}\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/1_goals::doc}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
This course emphasizes making models of physical phenomenon and how we use various tools at our disposal to investigate those models. Hence, we have learning objectives for making models of these systems and for learning specific tools.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Principle Learning Objectives}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Students will demonstrate they can:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
investigate physical systems of their choosing using a variety of tools and approaches

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
construct and document a reproducible process for those investigations

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches to answer specific questions in those investigations

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
provide evidence of the quality of their work using a variety of sources

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
collaborate effectively and contribute to a inclusive learning environment

\end{itemize}
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Each of these learning objectives contributes to your development as a physicist. I recognize that these are \sphinxstylestrong{big} ideas to think about. What I mean is that the objectives above are quite broad and you might be able to see a little about what or why they are included. But, below, I added more detail about each one along with a smaller scale list of objectives that you will engage with. Throughout our course, you will have opportunities to demonstrate these objectives in your work. \sphinxstyleemphasis{My aim is to make what you are assessed on in this course something you are interested in, so these objectives reflect that.}


\subsection{Investigate physical systems}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/1_goals:investigate-physical-systems}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Clearly, one of our central goals is learning how to make models of physical systems. This means learning about and developing fluency with a wide variety of mathematical and computational tools. In this courses, we will make extensive use of \sphinxhref{http://anaconda.org}{Jupyter notebooks} for homework and projects. In fact, what you are reading is a set of Jupyter notebooks! Below, you will see the list of objectives for this principal objective.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Investigating Physical Systems Learning Objectives}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Students will demonstrate they can:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
use mathematical techniques to predict or explain some physical phenomenon

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
employ computational models and algorithms to investigate physical systems

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
compare analytical and computational approaches to these investigations

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
provide coherent explanations for their investigations buttressed by physical, mathematical, and/or computational knowledge and principles

\end{itemize}
\end{sphinxadmonition}


\subsection{Construct and document a reproducible process}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/1_goals:construct-and-document-a-reproducible-process}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
A critical element of physics work is making sure that with the same setup and approach, others can reproduce the work you have done. This provides validity to your work and evidences how we develop collective understanding of physics. Physics is a social enterprise and the ensuring the reproducibility of work supports that enterprise. Below are the learning objectives for this principal objective.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Reproducibility Learning Objectives}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Students will demonstrate they can:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
document their work and analysis such that others can reproduce their work

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
consistently reproduce their work and results in a variety of contexts

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
provide an explanation for why certain work or results are not (or should not be) reproducible

\end{itemize}
\end{sphinxadmonition}


\subsection{Use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/1_goals:use-analytical-computational-and-graphical-approaches}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
The main approaches that we use to make models are mathematical, computational, and graphical. In this class, we will aim to leverage the benefits of each to learn more about the physical systems that we are investigating. Indeed, much of the “knowledge” that you are going to develop will be about specific analytical, computational, or graphical approaches to investigate physical systems. Below are the learning objectives for this principal objective.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Modeling Approaches Learning Objectives}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Students will demonstrate they can:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Use a wide variety of modeling techniques to investigate different physical systems

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Choose and employ appropriate approaches to modeling physical systems of their choosing

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Explain how those approaches lead to different results or conclusions

\end{itemize}
\end{sphinxadmonition}


\subsection{Provide evidence of the quality of their work}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/1_goals:provide-evidence-of-the-quality-of-their-work}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
The definition of the quality of a piece of science is a collective decision by the scientific community. In established communities, like physics, there are commonly\sphinxhyphen{}accepted ways of defining the quality of work (norms, customs, and rules all play a role). But that is not to mean those ways can’t change; papers describing quantum physics and relativity brushed up hard against this issue of quality and were both dismissed and celebrated. Newer disciplines are still establishing those norms and rules. And in some cases, disciplines are pushing back against Western norms of quality. In our class, we will collectively decide what we mean by ‘’high quality’’ work. Below are the learning objectives for this principal objective.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Quality Control Learning Objectives}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Students will demonstrate they can:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
describe what it means to have high quality work in our class

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
look for and evaluate when work meets those standards

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
provide suggestions (or act on suggestions) to improve the quality of their work

\end{itemize}
\end{sphinxadmonition}


\subsection{Collaborate effectively}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/1_goals:collaborate-effectively}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Physics is a social enterprise that relies on effective and productive collaborations. Very little (if any) science is done alone; the scale of science is too grand for individuals to effectively work – everyone needs a team. In this spirit, in this classroom, we deeply encourage collaboration. We will try to develop effective collaboration through your work on projects and our in\sphinxhyphen{}class activities. Below are the learning objectives for this principal objective.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Collaboration Learning Objectives}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Students will demonstrate they can:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Collaborate on a variety of activities in and out of class

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Document the contributions in these collaborations and make changes if contributions are unbalanced

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Develop personally effective strategies for collaboration

\end{itemize}
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\section{Course Design}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:course-design}}\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design::doc}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
For most of you, 415 is an elective course that you are taking to learn more about how we use mathematical techniques in physics. As such, this course is designed under several different principles than a standard course. Below, I provide those principles and their rationale.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
415 should help you learn the central tenets of modeling physical systems
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
The sheer volume of mathematical and computational physics knowledge out there is immense and impossible for any one person to learn. However, the central elements of making models, how to learn about specific techniques, and how to debug your approaches are things we can learn and employ broadly as well as to specific problems.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
415 should be a celebration of your knowledge
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
For most of you, this course is part of your senior level coursework. What you have achieved in the last three to four years should be celebrated and enjoyed. This course will provide ample opportunities for you to share what things you know and what things you are learning with me and with each other.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
415 should give you opportunities to engage in professional practice
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
As you start towards your professional career, it’s important to learn what professional scientists do. You have probably already begun this work in advanced lab and research projects that you have worked on. We will continue developing your professional skills in this course through the use of course projects.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
415 will illustrate that we can learn from each other
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Even though I’ve been learning physics for almost 20 years, I don’t know everything. I am excited to learn from you and I hope that you are excited to learn from me and each other.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Optional purchases:}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:optional-purchases}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
The core readings and work for this course will be this jupyterbook. I will find resources online, make my own, and provide as much organized free material as possible. If you want to have a textbook that helps you organize your readings, please obtain copies of:
\begin{enumerate}
\sphinxsetlistlabels{\arabic}{enumi}{enumii}{}{.}%
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Mary Boas, \sphinxhref{https://bookshop.org/p/books/mathematical-methods-in-the-physical-sciences-mary-l-boas/7483888}{\sphinxstyleemphasis{Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences}} (Wiley; 2005). This book is the definitive text on mathematical approaches, written by Dr. Boas originally in 1966! Any 3rd edition will be useful and I will put the section numbers from Boas in the online readings.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Mark Newman, \sphinxhref{https://bookshop.org/p/books/computational-physics-mark-newman/9385815}{\sphinxstyleemphasis{Computational Physics}} (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 2012). This book is a great introduction to a variety of computational physics techniques, written by UMich professor Mark Newman for a computational physics course. I will put section numbers from Newman in the online readings.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Course Activities}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:course-activities}}

\subsection{“Readings”}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:readings}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{“Reading”} is an essential part of 415! Reading the notes before class is very important. I use “reading” in quotes, because in our class this idea goes beyond just reading text and includes understanding figures and watching videos. These should help inform the basis of your understating that we will draw on in class to clarify your understanding and to help you make sense of the material. I will assume you have done the required readings in advance! It will make a huge difference if you spend the time and effort to carefully read and follow the resources posted. The calendar has the details on videos and readings that will be updated.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{Weekly Questions}: To encourage and reward you for keeping up with the “readings”, there will be weekly questions about the readings posted for you to respond to. These are not meant to test your knowledge, but rather to focus your “reading” towards what you understand, and what you don’t yet understand. I will ask you about those things weekly and use that information to tailor in\sphinxhyphen{}class activities based on what I am hearing is confusing, unclear, or challenging. These questions are only graded for completion, but I do want your honest attempt.


\subsection{Class Meetings}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:class-meetings}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{Classroom Etiquette:} Please silence your electronic devices when entering the classroom. I don’t mind you using them (in fact, see below, we will use them). But, sometimes, they can very distracting to your neighbors, so use your judgement. I appreciate that you might have questions or comments about things in class. We are going to be having short lectures combined with longer project work in class. So you will have plenty of time to catch up with social media and the news.

\sphinxAtStartPar
If you and/or your group mates are confused, just raise your hand and ask questions. If you are confused, you are likely not the only one and it’s better to chat about it, then move on. Questions are always good, and are strongly encouraged! \sphinxstyleemphasis{The only way we learn is to question what we know and how we know it.}

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{Computing Devices:} Please bring some sort of computing device to class everyday. You might be researching information online, reviewing work you have done, or actively building models of systems together. This device can be a computer, a tablet, or a phone. You can also partner up with folks because we will use them in groups. \sphinxstyleemphasis{If you need a computing device brought to class for you or your group mates to use, let me know. I will organize for some small collection of laptops if we need it.}

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{In\sphinxhyphen{}Class:} We will have some short lectures about topics or concepts; some of those will be in\sphinxhyphen{}the\sphinxhyphen{}moment as needed. The idea is that you are developing a basic understanding through readings and videos, practicing using those new ideas with me and with your classmates in class, and then applying what you are learning to new ideas. So, we will also use a variety of in\sphinxhyphen{}class activities that help you construct an understanding of a particular topic or concept. These will not be collected or graded, but we will discuss the solutions in class. \sphinxstyleemphasis{I will not post solutions for these activities as we have no exams or quizzes.}


\subsection{“Homework”}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:homework}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{Worked Problems:} We will spend much of our time learning specific techniques and approaches to use withh many different kinds of problems and models. Your “weekly” homework will be to select a particular example where the method or model applies, and work that problem yourself. You will need to explain your approach and findings on paper or in a notebook. You will turn in seven of eight of these worked problems. \sphinxstyleemphasis{I will not post solutions for these problems as we have no exams or quizzes.}


\subsection{Projects}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:projects}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{In\sphinxhyphen{}class Projects:} The class is designed to support your independent research into ideas that you are excited about. So in\sphinxhyphen{}class projects are meant to equip you with the knowledge and practice to learn new things for your projects. These in\sphinxhyphen{}class projects will be short demonstrations of models that you complete in groups. We will circulate around the room and check on you and your group’s progress and understanding. At the end of the class period, we will share the results of the in\sphinxhyphen{}class project and discuss any sticking points. These in\sphinxhyphen{}class activities will not be graded, but they will be essential for your out\sphinxhyphen{}of\sphinxhyphen{}class projects.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{Out\sphinxhyphen{}of\sphinxhyphen{}class Projects:} For this class, we anticipate 6 projects to be turned in roughly every 2\sphinxhyphen{}3 weeks, with a weeklong turn\sphinxhyphen{}in window (see calendar). Except for the first project, up to 3 of these projects can be completed as partner projects. Partner projects are subject to a different grading rubric that evaluates collaborative efforts and increases the expectation for other areas compared to an individual project. A preliminary rubric appears here, but we will define these collectively after the first project.

\sphinxAtStartPar
These projects will take the form a \sphinxhref{https://uio-ccse.github.io/computational-essay-showroom/}{computational essay}, which provides documentation and rationale for the exploration that you are completing. We will model a computational essay project in our first project and we will reflect on the rubric after it, and make changes collectively as a class to it.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstyleemphasis{I strongly encourage collaboration}, an essential skill in science and engineering (and highly valued by employers!) Social interactions are critical to scientists’ success – most good ideas grow out of discussions with colleagues, and essentially all physicists work as part of a group. Find partners and work together. However, it is also important that you OWN the material. I strongly suggest you start working by yourself (and that means really making an extended effort on every activity). Then work with a group, and finally, finish up on your own – write up your own work, in your own way. There will also be time for peer discussion during classes – as you work together, try to help your partners get over confusions, listen to them, ask each other questions, critique, teach each other. You will learn a lot this way! For all assignments, the work you turn in must in the end be your own: in your own words, reflecting your own understanding. (If, at any time, for any reason, you feel disadvantaged or isolated, contact me and I can discretely try to help arrange study groups.)


\subsubsection{Help Session}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/2_design:help-session}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Help sessions/office hours are to facilitate your learning. We encourage attendance \sphinxhyphen{} plan on working in small groups, our role will be as learning coaches. The sessions are concept and project\sphinxhyphen{}centric, but we will not be explicitly telling anyone how to do your project (how would that help you learn?) I strongly encourage you to start all projects on your own. If you come to help sessions “cold”, the value of the project to you will be greatly reduced.

\section{Assessments}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/3_assessments:assessments}}\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/3_assessments::doc}}

\subsection{Formative Assessment}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/3_assessments:formative-assessment}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Formative assessment is often ungraded and reflective assessment. It is meant to help you make changes to your thinking, approaches, or practice. It is not evaluative, it’s corrective; to help you make changes. We will make heavy use of ungraded formative feedback throughout the course. Our weekly readings and your worked problems are meant to be formative; meaning most folks will receive full credit, but the important part to review the feedback and reflect on it.


\subsection{Summative Assessment}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/3_assessments:summative-assessment}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Summative assessment is typically evaluative and will take the form of course projects completed out of class. These projects will take the form of a computational essay in which you write mathematics and code to investigate and explain a given phenomenon of interest. We will explore those essays in class and talk about what makes a useful one as we define a rubric for evaluation.


\subsubsection{Preliminary Rubric}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/3_assessments:preliminary-rubric}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
A preliminary rubric has been posted. We will use this rubric for the first out\sphinxhyphen{}of\sphinxhyphen{}class project evaluation. We will then reflect on it and make changes to collectively as a class.

\section{Classroom Environment}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/6_environment:classroom-environment}}\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/6_environment::doc}}

\subsection{Commitment to an Inclusive Classroom}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/6_environment:commitment-to-an-inclusive-classroom}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
I am deeply committed to creating an inclusive classroom \sphinxhyphen{} one where you and your classmates
feel comfortable, intellectually challenged, and able to speak up about your ideas
and experiences. This means that our classroom, our virtual environments, and our interactions
need to be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen
and observe others are central to creating a classroom that is inclusive. I will strive to
do this and I ask that you do the same. If I can do anything to make the classroom a better
learning environment for you, please let me know.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{If you observe or experience behaviors that violate our commitment to inclusivity,
please let me know as soon as possible.}

\sphinxAtStartPar
If I violate this principle, please let me know or please tell the undergraduate department chair, Stuart Tessmer (\sphinxhref{mailto:tessmer@pa.msu.edu}{tessmer@pa.msu.edu}), who I have informed to tell me about any such incidents without conveying student information to me.


\subsection{Comments on preparation:}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/6_environment:comments-on-preparation}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Physics 415 covers material you might have seen before. Many of the topics
stem from a wide variety of physics courses you might have already taken. But, we might be applying them at a higher level of conceptual and mathematical sophistication.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Therefore you should expect:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
a large amount of material to review and digest.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
no recitations, and few examples covered in lecture. Most of the learning will be done through projects and questions you and your group mates raise.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
long, hard problems that usually cannot be completed by one individual alone.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
challenging projects.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
to learn more about being a physicist that you have in another class (I hope!).

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Physics 415 is a challenging, upper‐division physics course. Unlike more introductory courses, you are fully responsible for your own learning. In particular, you control the pace of the course by asking questions in class. I tend to speak quickly, and questions are important to slow down. This means that if you don’t understand something, it is your responsibility to ask questions. Attending class and the help sessions gives you an opportunity to ask questions. I am here to help you as much as possible, but I need your questions to know what you don’t understand.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Physics 415 covers some of the most important physics and mathematical methods in the field. Your reward for the hard work and effort will be learning important and elegant material that you will use over and over as a physics major. Here is what I have experienced, and heard from
other faculty teaching upper division physics in the past:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
most students reported spending a minimum of 10 hours per week on the
homework (!!)

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
students who didn’t attend the help sessions
often did poorly in the class.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
students reported learning a tremendous amount in this class.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{The course topics that we will cover in Physics 415 are among the
greatest intellectual achievements of humans. Don’t be surprised if you
have to think hard and work hard to master the material.}


\subsection{Use of Generative AI Tools}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/6_environment:use-of-generative-ai-tools}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
You are welcome to use generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Dall\sphinxhyphen{}e, etc.) in this class as doing so aligns with the course learning goals. These tools can be useful in gathering information, troubleshooting code, and developing potential directions. However, you are responsible for the information you submit based on an AI query (for instance, that it does not violate intellectual property laws, or contain misinformation or unethical content). Your use of AI tools must be properly documented and cited in order to stay within university policies on academic integrity and the \sphinxhref{https://spartanexperiences.msu.edu/about/handbook/spartan-code-of-honor-academic-pledge/index.html}{Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge}.

\sphinxAtStartPar
For example, if generative AI is used to develop code or make sense of results, the original query, the resulting text, and your discussion of how that information was synthesized and used is \sphinxstylestrong{required} to be submitted with your work. This can be in an appendix if it distracts from the presentation of your work. Remember, AI is not likely to generate a response that would be seen as quality work and should be modified and improved. AI cannot think critically, so you must do that work. More details or the rationale for this policy can be found here: \sphinxurl{https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse202-F23-jb/course\_materials/CMSE202\_GenerativeAI\_Policy.html}

\subsection{Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/7_resources:confidentiality-and-mandatory-reporting}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
College students often experience issues that may interfere with academic success such as academic stress, sleep problems, juggling responsibilities, life events, relationship concerns, or feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or depression.
As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment and to support you through these situations and experiences.
I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a University employee.
It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom
discussions, in written work, and in one\sphinxhyphen{}on\sphinxhyphen{}one meetings.
I will seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent possible.
However, under Title IX, I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct, relationship violence, or information
about criminal activity on MSU’s campus with the University including the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE).

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting MSU Counseling and Psychiatric Service (CAPS) (\sphinxhref{http://caps.msu.edu}{caps.msu.edu}, 517\sphinxhyphen{}355\sphinxhyphen{}8270), MSU’s 24\sphinxhyphen{}hour Sexual Assault Crisis Line (\sphinxhref{http://endrape.msu.edu}{endrape.msu.edu}, 517\sphinxhyphen{}372\sphinxhyphen{}6666), or Olin Health Center (\sphinxhref{http://olin.msu.edu}{olin.msu.edu}, 517\sphinxhyphen{}884\sphinxhyphen{}6546).}


\subsection{Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/7_resources:spartan-code-of-honor-academic-pledge}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.


\subsection{Handling Emergency Situations}
\label{\detokenize{content/0_course/7_resources:handling-emergency-situations}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstyleemphasis{In the event of an emergency arising within the classroom, Prof. Caballero will notify you of what actions that may be required to ensure your safety. It is the responsibility of each student to understand the evacuation, “shelter\sphinxhyphen{}in\sphinxhyphen{}place,” and “secure\sphinxhyphen{}in\sphinxhyphen{}place” guidelines posted in each facility and to act in a safe manner. You are allowed to maintain cellular devices in a silent mode during this course, in order to receive emergency SMS text, phone or email messages distributed by the university. When anyone receives such a notification or observes an emergency situation, they should immediately bring it to the attention of Prof. Caballero in a way that causes the least disruption. If an evacuation is ordered, please ensure that you do it in a safe manner and facilitate those around you that may not otherwise be able to safely leave. When these orders are given, you do have the right as a member of this community to follow that order. Also, if a shelter\sphinxhyphen{}in\sphinxhyphen{}place or secure\sphinxhyphen{}in\sphinxhyphen{}place is ordered, please seek areas of refuge that are safe depending on the emergency encountered and provide assistance if it is advisable to do so.}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Nature reveals itself to us through interactions. We can tell from observations that it is nature’s interactions that lead to its evolution. How nature is changing and predicting how it will change in the future is the work of science. In this work, we observe nature and its interactions to make models of those observations. We aim to predict and explain our observations of nature through this building of models.

\sphinxAtStartPar
In physics, our goals are typically to explain and predict observations of physical phenomenon. Here, we focus ourselves to those canonical things that physicists concern themselves with: motion, fields, waves, atoms, nuclei, and so on.

\section{Models and modeling}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/modeling/activity-what_is_a_model:models-and-modeling}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
This course focuses on common physical models and how we use mathematics and computing tools to investigate these models. But, we need to agree on an mutual understanding of a model. In this activity, you will be working in a group to define aspects of a good model for the physical sciences.

\sphinxAtStartPar
There are plenty of ideas on the internet, I can even \sphinxhref{https://bfy.tw/TUdA}{provide you a link} with plenty of information. But, the point of this activity is for us to define a good model now (given all your prior experiences with models and modeling), and to reflect on that definition as you develop expertise with models and modeling (through your learning in this class).

\subsection{History and Philosophy of Science}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/modeling/activity-what_is_a_model:history-and-philosophy-of-science}}

If you would like to dive deeper into models and modeling, there’s excellent work in history and philosophy of science. The field studies how science develops knowledge, practice, culture, and so on. It studies important events and provides critical information on important and, often, overlooked folks who do science. For example, historian and gender studies professor \sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon\_Traweek}{Sharon Traweek} studies the high energy physics field. Her book, \sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamtimes\_and\_Lifetimes}{Beamtimes and Lifetimes: The World of High Energy Physicists} {[}\hyperlink{cite.jb_reference/markdown:id5}{Tra09}{]} is excellent.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Dame Nancy Cartwright (philosopher of science)}

\sphinxAtStartPar
One of the more interesting scholars in \sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy\_Cartwright\_(philosopher)}{Dame Nancy Cartwright} who wrote a lot about the ‘practice of science.’ Her philosophical work informed many of the innovations in physics and broader science education – including many science courses at MSU.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Her writing is very interesting, but the style of writing can be a challenge to read. This is the nature of academic writing in different disciplines. Her book called “How The Laws of Physics Lie” {[}\hyperlink{cite.jb_reference/markdown:id6}{Car83}{]} is worth a read. Here’s a link to the \sphinxhref{http://www.generativescience.org/papers/nature/Cartwright-\_1983.pdf}{first chapter}.

\chapter{29 Sept 23 \sphinxhyphen{} Notes: Simple Harmonic Oscillator}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:sept-23-notes-simple-harmonic-oscillator}}\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO::doc}}

\section{A Linear Restoring Force}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:a-linear-restoring-force}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
The SHO model, as we will see, is the root of many more sophisticated models in physics – across many subdisciplines. There’s a reason for this. The SHO is a simple model that captures the essence of many physical systems. It is a mathematical model for a “linear restoring force”. Such a force gives rise to local stability, that is, a tendency for the system to return to a stable equilibrium position. The richness of this statement is not entirely clear, but we will see that it is a very powerful idea, that is related to to energy minimization, and the idea of a potential energy function.

\sphinxAtStartPar
A linear restoring force is simply one in which the size of the force is in direct proportion to some displacement and is directed opposite to the displacement. For example, a coiled spring exerts (rooughly) a linear restoring force. If you pull on a spring, the spring exerts a force on your hand that is proportional to the distance you pull the spring. It is directed opposite to the direction you pull.

\sphinxAtStartPar
In 1D, we can write this as:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}F_{\rm spring} = -kx\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
where \(k\) is the spring constant. The negative sign indicates that the force is directed opposite to the displacement, and \(x\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position. As we are going to consider more general motion, we can abstract this concept of a linear restoring force to three dimensions, and write:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}\vec{F}_{\rm spring} = -k \Delta \vec{x}\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
where \(\Delta \vec{x}\) is the displacement vector from the equilibrium position.


\section{The SHO mathematical model}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:the-sho-mathematical-model}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
We have seen that the canonical one\sphinxhyphen{}dimensional harmonic oscillator is described with the following \sphinxstylestrong{2nd order linear} differential equation:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}m\ddot{s} = -k{s}\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
where \(s\) represents the distance from the oscillator’s equilibrium position. It’s important to note that this model for a linear restoring force gives rise to at \sphinxstylestrong{second order} differential equation. As you will see, there would be no ability for cycles or recurrent behavior without two dimensions (the two dimensions here are the position, \(s\), and velocity of the oscillator, \(\dot{s}\)). It is also important that the differential equation is \sphinxstylestrong{linear}.


\subsection{Linearity of differential equations}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:linearity-of-differential-equations}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
This is something that is easy to confuse because we use the term \sphinxstylestrong{linear} in different ways at different times. In many cases this prompts us to think of a line, so that we might think the only linear differential equations are ones where the variable of interest (in this case the position of the oscillator) appears only \sphinxstyleemphasis{linearly} in the equation.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{warning}{Warning:}
\sphinxAtStartPar
So you might think that Nth order differential equations of the form:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}\dfrac{d^n x}{dt^n} = c\;x\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
are the only ones that are linear. \sphinxstyleemphasis{Note for the harmonic oscillator \(n=2\); \(c<0\).}

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{That is not the case and this is key.}

\sphinxAtStartPar
The linearity refers to the fact that we can write the differential equation as a \sphinxstylestrong{linear combination of the derivatives}.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Linear Differential Equations}

\sphinxAtStartPar
So an \(N\)th linear differential equation (e.g., for position and time) can have the general form:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}\sum_{i=0}^N a_i(t)\dfrac{d^ix}{dt} = f(t)\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
where \(\dfrac{d^ix}{dt}\) is the \(i\)th derivative of \(x\) (e.g., \(i=0\), \(\dfrac{d^0x}{dt}=x\); \(i=1\), \(\dfrac{d^1x}{dt}=\dfrac{dx}{dt}\)) The coefficients are allowed to depend explicitly on time (i.e., \(a_i(t)\); you have probably seen \sphinxstyleemphasis{constant coefficients} in the past (where \(\dfrac{da_i(t)}{dt}=0\), i.e., \(a_i(t) =\) constant). In addition, as you can explore later, the system can be driven by a function that depends only on time (e.g., some forcing function, \(f(t)\)).
\end{sphinxadmonition}


\subsection{Why does linearity matter?}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:why-does-linearity-matter}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Because much of nature can be modeled with linear differential equations (or approximately so) and linear differential equations have really nice solution properties. *The solutions to linear differential equations are \sphinxstylestrong{holonomic functions}. This is just a fancy word for functions you know like polynomials, sine, cosine, exponentiale, and some special functions (e.g., Airy, Bessel, hypergeometric). But these solutions are really important because they are smooth as are their derivatives, so they have really nice properties.

\sphinxAtStartPar
In many cases, we can lean on strong properties derived from linearity:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy\%E2\%80\%93Kowalevski\_theorem}{Uniqueness}: If we find a solution to the differential equation and it satisfies the boundary/initial conditions, we are guaranteed that this is the only solution.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Linear combinations: The linear nature of the differential equation means linear combinations of general solutions are unchanged. We can build solutions from known general solutions.

\end{itemize}

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{The Cauchy\sphinxhyphen{}Kowaleski theorem}

\sphinxAtStartPar
This theorem is typically called the Cauchy theorem (or the uniqueness theorem) for \sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis\_Cauchy}{Augustin Louis\sphinxhyphen{}Cachy}, a French mathematician who contributed much to the field of complex analysis. However, Cauchy only proved this theorem in a special case.  A Russian Mathematician, \sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofya\_Kovalevskaya}{Sofya Kovalevskaya}, who was the first woman to earn a PhD in Mathematics (earned 1874, University of Göttingen), proved the theorem, in general, in her dissertation.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{So, it is really the “Kovalevskaya\sphinxhyphen{}Cauchy” theorem.}
\end{sphinxadmonition}


\subsection{General Solution to the SHO}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:general-solution-to-the-sho}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
We can start with the differential equation:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}\ddot{x} = -\omega^2 x\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
where \(x\) is the position relative to equilibrium and \(\omega^2 = k/m\). We know this is a linear, second\sphinxhyphen{}order ODE, so we expect the solutions to be \sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic\_function}{holonomic functions} \sphinxhyphen{} that is, many of the functions we have seen before. Moreover, we need something that when we take two derivatives, we get the same functions back.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstyleemphasis{This is a key to suggest \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) as our proposed linear combination.}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Now, we have to decide how to do that. Because \sphinxstylestrong{ANY} linear combination is a good starting guess, but not all of them a reasonable guesses. How do we decide?

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Discussion Question}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Below are several choices of potential general solution guesses, called “ansatz” in many books and classes.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Which of them will work for us? How do you know? Demonstrate that one solution you chose works.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}x(t) = A\cos(\omega t)\end{split}
\end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}x(t) = B\sin(\omega t)\end{split}
\end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}x(t) = A\cos(\omega t)+B\sin(\omega t)\end{split}
\end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}x(t) = B\sin(\omega t+ \phi_B)\end{split}
\end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}x(t) = \sum_i^N A_i\cos(\omega_i t) + B_i\sin(\omega_i t)\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{What other general solution forms will work?}
\end{sphinxadmonition}
\subsubsection*{Hint}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Can you think of other functions that when you take two derivatives, you get the same function back with a sign change?

\sphinxAtStartPar
What if the function were complex (recall: \(i^2 = -1\))?


\subsection{Particular Solutions}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:particular-solutions}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Let’s pick two general solutions. Notice that both have two unknown constants. We can use the initial conditions to determine the values of these constants, and thus our particular solutions.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}x(t) = A\cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t)\end{split}
\end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}x(t) = C\sin(\omega t + \phi_C)\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\sphinxAtStartPar
To determine a particular solution is to solve for the \sphinxstylestrong{trajectory} of the system given a set of initial conditions. You can think about a falling object, but any physical system that is evolving in time will have a trajectory in the general sense of various changing observable quantities. We will revisit this idea later once we make the connection to \sphinxhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical\_system}{Dynamical Systems}.


\subsubsection{Find a particular solution}
\label{\detokenize{content/1_mechanics/sho/notes-SHO:find-a-particular-solution}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
For an SHO that is pulled to a point \(x_0\) and let go at \(t=0\), let’s find the particular solutions using both general forms.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{Compare and contrast these solutions with your neighbor.} What do you notice about them? How can they be made compatible with each other?
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Make a plot (in this notebook) of both solutions for an SHO with frequency of 100Hz that starts at \(x_0 =\) 0.1m

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Adjust the starting location and frequency, what do you notice?

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxstylestrong{If you have time}, create another solution for an SHO that is put into motion with a velocity of +0.1m/s at \(x_0=0\) at \(t=0\).
