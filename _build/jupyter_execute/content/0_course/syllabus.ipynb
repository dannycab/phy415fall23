    "In designing this course, I plan to emphasize more independent learning on your part and greater agency for you in determining what you learn and how you demonstrate you have learned. So you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * to read a variety of pieces of information to coordinate information\n",
    "  * to present your ideas publicly and to discuss them\n",
    "  * to learn new approaches and novel techniques on your own\n",
    "  * to become more expert than me in the areas of your interest\n",
    "  * to learn more about scientists that you have not learned about\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that you are on your own. Here's what you can expect from me:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * resources, information, and tools to help you learn\n",
    "  * support and scaffolding to move you towards more independence in your learning\n",
    "  * timely and detailed feedback to help you along\n",
    "  * a commitment to an inclusive classroom\n",

    "## Grading\n",
    "Details about [course activities are here](design.md) and [information regarding assessment is here](assessments.md). Your grade will be comprised of weekly discussion questions and several projects that you will complete in the form of a Jupyter notebook (a \"computational essay\", which we will discuss later). Your grade on each project is split between completion (50%) and quality (50%). We will collectively define \"quality\" in class, but we have provided [a preliminary rubric](rubric.md) for us to work from for the first project. Your final grade will be scaled based on your best performances; there will be slightly more projects than what comprises your grade.  *The intent here is to to allow you space to explore a model or project that you really enjoy, and to reward you for doing that.* How your grade is calculated appears below.\n",
