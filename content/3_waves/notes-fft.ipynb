    "It might not have been obvious to you, but our work so far has expected that our $V(t)$ be a continuous function of time, and that we can sample it any time we want. In reality, you are limited to the response of your equipment, which leads to a phenomenon knows as the [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem). This theorem states that if you want to study a signal with a frequency $f$, you need to sample it at least $2f$ times per second. This is known as the [Nyquist frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency). If you don't sample at least this often, you will get aliasing, which is when a signal at a higher frequency is indistinguishable from a signal at a lower frequency. As you can tell, there's a lot of issues with sampling when it comes to studying signals.\n",
