    "As we have realized, solving field problems using vector equations is not always the best way to go about solving our problems. The integrals can be difficult to set up and the equations might be difficult, if not, impossible to solve (e.g., because there is no anti-derivative for the integrand). While we might not fully eliminate the need for vector equations, in electrostatic situations, we can posit the [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential), $\\Phi$. **We changed to using $\\Phi$ because there are also things like $dV$ -- volume elements. The scalar field, $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is given by Poisson's equation as it is related to the eletric field by the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\rightarrow \\vec{E} = -\\nabla \\Phi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot (-\\nabla \\Phi) = -\\nabla^2 \\Phi = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 \\Phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have seen, there is an integral form of the electric potential. This is built up from the description that we have seen for the electric field of a point charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{E}_{pt} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{r^2}\\hat{r} \\rightarrow \\Phi_{pt} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q}{r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or more generally, for a continuous charge distribution,\n",

    "$$\\Phi = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\iiint\\frac{\\rho dV}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like we have done with the electric field, one can set up a forward integral formulation of the electric potential and add up the elements to find the total potential. However, this is typically not the best way to solve electric potential problems because they often only work for specific geometries and at certain locations. Instead, we will use the differential form of the electric potential where there are no charges, but the boundaries are set to a given potential. This is called **Laplace's equation**.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While Poisson's equation describes how the value of the local Laplacian of the electric potential is directly related to the local electric potential, there are many places where there are no charges. For example, it's common to solve problems where the **boundary conditions** are set to a given potential or with a certain amount of charge, and the remaining space is empty (or free space). This doesn't mean that an electric field is not present in that empty space, but rather that there are no charges. In this case, the problem that are solving is called **Laplace's equation** - a special case of Poisson's equation where $\\rho = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 \\Phi = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important ways to go about solving these problems. The first is using separation of variables, which is a common analytical technique. The second is to use numerical methods that we will discuss later in the course. Both of these methods rely on the the following properties of the solutions to Laplace's equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Solutions to Laplace's Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Phi$ has no local maxima or minima except at boundaries\n",
    "2. $\\Phi$ is smooth and continuous everywhere\n",
    "3. $\\Phi$ is single valued\n",
    "4. $\\Phi$ at a location is the average of the values of $\\Phi$ over the surrounding space\n",
    "5. $\\Phi$ is unique. There is only one solution to Laplace's equation for a given set of boundary conditions."

    "Consider a metal gutter that extends into infinitely in the $z$ direction. The gutter width in the $y$ direction is $a$. It is placed in the $y-z$ plane and the $+x$ direction is not constrained and extends to infinity (both the wall at $y=0$ and $y=a$). So that Laplace's equation applies in the region:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. any $z$ value\n",
    "2. $x > 0$\n",
    "3. $0 < y < a$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "What uniquely determines our solution to Laplace's equation are the boundary conditions. For this case, we are going to set all the conditions to zero except one to illustrate the way we find those unique solutions. The boundary conditions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Phi(x>0, y=0) = 0$ Grounded\n",
    "2. $\\Phi(x>0, y=a) = 0$ Grounded\n",
    "3. $\\Phi(x=0, 0 < y < a) = V_0(y)$ Set potential at the bottom of the gutter\n",
    "4. $\\Phi(x\\rightarrow \\infty,0<y<a) = 0$ Potential goes to zero at infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have infinite extent in the $z$ direction, we don't need to solve for that direction. We can assume the potential looks the same for every slice of the $x-y$ plane in the region. This means we can simplify our approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 \\Phi = \\nabla^2 \\Phi(x,y) = 0 \\longrightarrow \\Phi(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**&#9989; Do this** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the proposed solution, use separation of variables to find ODEs for $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$.\n",
    "2. Solve the ODEs for $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$ in general. How do you choose which general solution to use in which direction?\n",
    "3. Apply the boundary conditions to solve for the constants in the general solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that applying the boundary condition for $x=a$ will result in an equation of the form $V(0,y) = C'\\sin(ky)$ where $C'$ and $k$ are some constants.** This is a new thing that we running up against. It requires that we use Fourier's trick to solve for the appropriate constants. This will lead us into [orthgonal functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_functions) and [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series)."
